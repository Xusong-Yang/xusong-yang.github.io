This is Xusong's home on web!

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. I received my Ph.D. in geophysics at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGGCAS) at 2022, and my B.S. degree at Jilin University in 2015.

I am currently working with Dr. Guoqing Lin on investigating the magmatic plumbing system beneath Mauna Loa volcano.
